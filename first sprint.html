        <h2>Start of his career</h2>
        <p>
        Ali Sadpara is one of the very few names in the country who have risen up at a global level. Started as a
        porter, Ali made his
        first-ever proper climb in 2004 while accompanying an expedition to K2. He shared in an interview with Dawn that
        one of his first jobs was to deliver supplies to Pakistan Army posts leading to Siachen back in the mid-1990s.

        In his profile in Alpinist magazine, Ali shared his story about getting the opportunity that opened his doors
        towards high peaks. According to Ali, an army truck arrived at Sadpara village to recruit porters. Having a
        passion for mountains, Ali could not resist the chance and decided to pursue it. However, this was around the
        same time when Pakistan and India were locked in the Siachen Glacier conflict. Ali headed into the world’s
        highest battleground to deliver supplies to the Pak army. It was a thrilling experience for him and helped him
        overcome his fears.

        Moreover, Ali’s family wanted him to join the police force or the army. These jobs offered good wages and also a
        place to live. However, Ali did not settle for this and chose to follow his heart and climb the highest peaks
        across the country. </p>
